## Task 1
In this task, we have two functions:
- `processArray`: It takes an array of numbers and returns a new array where each even number is squared and each odd number is tripled.
- `formatArrayStrings`: It takes two arrays as arguments, an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by `processArray`, and modifies each string based on its corresponding number. It capitalizes the entire string if the number is even and converts the string to lowercase if the number is odd. The modified strings are returned as a new array.

## Task 2
In this task, we build upon the functions from Task 1 and introduce a new function:
- `createUserProfiles`: It takes an array of original names and an array of modified names, and creates an array of objects, each containing the original name, modified name, and an auto-incremented ID starting from 1.
